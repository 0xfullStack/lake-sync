# lake-sync
[![ Continuous Integration](https://github.com/cryptoless/lake-sync/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/cryptoless/lake-sync/actions/workflows/ci.yml)


Cryptoless lake-sync is a tool for polling and subscribing LP info quickly from EVM compatible.

Cryptoless lake-sync is an open source Rust implementation that event sources the Ethereum blockchain to deterministically update a data store that can be queried via lake-scan rest api.


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Rust (latest stable) â€“ [How to install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
  - Note that `rustfmt`, which is part of the default Rust installation, is a build-time requirement.
- PostgreSQL â€“ [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

For Ethereum network data, you can either run your own Ethereum node or use an Ethereum node provider of your choice.

**Minimum Hardware Requirements:**

- To build lake-sync with `cargo`, 8GB RAM are required.

## Project Layout

- `abi` â€” Used to store contract abi json files.
- `db` â€” Generate connection to PostgreSQL using Diesel orm framework.
- `dex` â€” core polling and syncing logic, divided into data assembler and data subscriber.
